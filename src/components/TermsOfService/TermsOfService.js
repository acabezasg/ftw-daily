      <h2>Liability</h2>

      <p>1. You acknowledge that Trust My Pet Sitter is not a party to any agreement between Pet Owners and Pet Sitters. Accordingly, Trust My Pet Sitter will not be liable for any breach of a contract between Pet Owners and Pet Sitters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Pet Sitter is solely responsible for carrying out the Pet Sitting Services. Trust My Pet Sitter assumes no liability for any loss or damage suffered by a Pet Owner, including harm caused to their Pet, which is caused by the Pet Sitter's action or inaction.</p>

      <p>3. Pet Sitters agree to indemnify us for any loss or damage we may suffer as a result of any Pet Owner bringing any claim against us or taking any action against us as a result of any breach by Pet Sitters of these Terms of Service or any agreement with Pet Owners.</p>

      <p>6. We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Service is reasonably available during normal business hours.</p>
      <p>7. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet and technology, the Service (save as set out in clause 20.1 above) is provided on an "as available" and "as is" basis. This means that we are unable to promise that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the performance or availability of the Service in these Terms of Service and, to the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law.</p>

      <p>2. If you have a dispute with another person who has registered with our Service in connection with the Service, we will provide reasonable assistance to resolve such disputes informally.

      <h2>Changes to the Service</h2>

      <p>1. We are constantly updating and improving the Service to try and find ways to provide you with new and innovative features and services. Improvements and updates are also made to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the way people use the Internet and our Service.</p>

Any changes to the Service could involve your Service elements being deleted or reset.</p>
      <p>3. You agree that a key characteristic of our Service is that changes to the Service will take place over time and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to the Service.

      <p>4. Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become effective. However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give you any notice.</p>

      <h2>Documents that apply to our relationship with you</h2>

      <p>1. The current version of the Terms of Service contains the only terms and conditions that apply to our relationship with you. Older versions of the Terms of Service will no longer apply to our relationship and will be completely replaced by the current version.</p>
      <p>2. We intend to rely on these Terms of Service as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you for the provision of the Service. If part of the Terms of Service cannot be enforced then the remainder of the Terms of Service will still apply to our relationship.</p>
      <p>3. If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we have and we may still take action in the future.</p>

      <h2>Severability</h2>

      <p>1. If any provision of these Terms of Service is judged to be illegal or unenforceable, this will not affect the continuation in full force and effect of the remainder of the provisions.</p>
